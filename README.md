# Solo DSA Bug Repository

Welcome to the Solo DSA Bug repository! üöÄ This is where I'm keeping track of my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice, focusing on Java. If you're curious about how I'm tackling DSA questions or if you're looking for Java solutions, you're in the right place.

## What's Inside

- **Questions:** You'll find a collection of DSA questions from various sources, all ready to be tackled.

- **Solutions:** I've provided Java solutions to each question, demonstrating how I approached the problems.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using this command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/akhilajohnsonc/solo_dsa_bug.git
   ```

2. **Explore:** Browse through the list of DSA questions to find ones that interest you.

3. **Solutions in Java:** Open the corresponding solution files to see how I've solved the problems using Java.

## Contributions Welcome

While this repository primarily serves as my personal DSA playground, I'm open to contributions. If you have improvements, better solutions, or explanations in Java for any of the questions, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.

Happy coding and bug hunting! üêõüîç
